          "details": "In C, variables serve as named storage locations that hold data, and each variable is associated with a specific data type that determines the size and format of the data it can store. Fundamental data types include:\n\n- **int**: for whole numbers.\n- **float** and **double**: for floating-point numbers, with double offering more precision.\n- **char**: for single characters.\n\nA strong grasp of variables involves understanding declaration, initialization, and the scope (local vs. global) and lifetime of variables. You'll also explore constants, which are immutable values, and how to manage memory allocation for different data types. Mastering these basics is crucial for building a solid foundation in C programming."
